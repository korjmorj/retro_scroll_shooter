## What we (me) have right now?
Fire system!!!
> - Go to file spawner.cs in Assets/Scripts and take it! (You will need BulletSpawnData.cs and EnegryBullet.cs also) 
> - I added some new patterns like spirals and flowers (?)
> - Enemies can fly at some coordinates and have their own shields! (check Enemy.cs or something like it) :feelsgood:

Asteroids!
> - Well, I don't like to speak about this level, check the scripts yoursels


## What I need to do? :scroll:
